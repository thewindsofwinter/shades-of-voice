# Colors of Sound

This project stemmed out of an interesting discussion with friends about describing the sounds of human voices in terms of colors: for example, someone's voice might be "bright yellow" or "soft purple"... but how do we quantify that?

There are a couple metrics that we can easily analyze, which I'm planning on using in the first phase of development.

 - [ ] Volume of the voice
 - [ ] Pitch of the voice
 - [ ] Zero-crossing value
 - [ ] Spectral bandwidth
 - [ ] Spectral centroid (maybe? different from pitch detection)

I'll find if I can relate these to HSV values, whether arbitrarily or through machine learning based on subjective perceptions of voice colors.
